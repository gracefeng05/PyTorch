## MNIST Digit Classification Using CNN
This repository contains a Python script for training and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digit images widely used for training various machine learning models.
### Dependencies
Python 3.x
PyTorch
torchvision
### Usage
Run the classifier.py script to train the CNN model on the MNIST dataset and evaluate its performance.
The script will print the training and testing loss, as well as the accuracy of the model on the test set.
After training, the script will display the prediction of the trained model on a sample image from the test set.
